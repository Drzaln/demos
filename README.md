Demos 2023 - Rewind: [Twitter Post](https://x.com/reactiive_/status/1740314524501078359)

## Quick Start

This is an Expo Go project. To get started:

```bash
yarn install
yarn ios     # for iOS
# or
yarn android # for Android
```

## What's Inside

Built with some awesome tech:
- Expo
- React Native
- React Native Reanimated
- React Native Skia
- TypeScript
- React Navigation

Note: This app is built with Expo SDK 51. I'm working on updating it to the latest version but there are some known issues with the latest version. (i.e. the animated blur won't work on many animations https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/32781)

## Setting Things Up

You'll need:
- Node.js (LTS)
- Yarn
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator
- Expo CLI
